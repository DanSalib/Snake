# Snake
Snake game to be played in console. Python Project

Run the Snake.py file in your terminal to start the game
Note: Resizing your terminal will affect the size of the gamme board. More bugs are apparent when the console window is too large or too small. Game works better with a smaller terminal, just make sure it is not too small.

The snake will grow and move faster as you collect more apples ('#')

If a border is hit or the snake hits itself, the game will end.
